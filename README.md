# IGBot
#
#
## This is a bot that scrapes a certain number of followers from a given account.
## Then, it selects the profiles that have less followers than following and stores them in an array.
## Finally, the bot proceeds to follow the selected profiles in the array.
##
## Future roadmap:
##  - Make the bot programmable to choose which accounts followers to scrape, and how many to scrape.

# INSTALL A DRIVER (LocalHost)
# If you are running your code on a localhost, then you'll need to install a chromedriver from here. Install and extract the chromedriver.exe file and save it in your project folder. Make sure to install the version that matches your Chrome version. To check your chrome version, type chrome://version/ in the chrome address bar.
